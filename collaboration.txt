Collaboration file highlighting the contributions of each team member:
For the virtual machine (vm.c) we collaborated using GitHub and Slack to write
the code for the virtual machine and communicate effectively. Due to the fact
that we all played a part and didn't have set tasks for each member, below
we have supplied our GitHub usernames and the repository where we worked on
vm.c and from there one will be able to see everyone's contribution.
