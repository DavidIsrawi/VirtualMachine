For the virtual machine (vm.c) we collaborated using GitHub and Slack to write
the code for the virtual machine and communicate effectively. Due to the fact
that we all played a part and didn't have set tasks for each member, below
we have supplied our GitHub usernames and the repository where we worked on
vm.c and from there one will be able to see everyone's contribution.

For the lexer (lexer.c) we collaborated using GitHub and Slack to write
the code for the lexical analyzer and error handling. Tyler and Georg worked on the structure of the token analyzer, making sure the we could scan the information with the struct implemented. Kenneth and David worked on printing the data to achieve the expected output. The error handling was mostly made by Tyler, but the team contributed with different cases. Below we have supplied our GitHub usernames and the repository where we worked on lexer.c and from there one will be able to see everyone's contribution.
